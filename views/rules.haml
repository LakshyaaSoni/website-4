        %h1 Rules

      %p The rules for the 1545 are fairly straightforward. Rules for each game generally follow those posted on their respective <a href="http://speedrun.com">speedrun.com</a> pages. However, there are a few changes, mainly easing some restrictions on how runs are validated. For simplicity, the rules for each game are listed below the General Rules section.

      %p If you have any questions about these rules, feel free to contact an organizer for clarification.

        %h1 General Rules

      %ol
        %li The first runner for each team will be in a general voice chat and will begin their game when an organizer says go after a countdown.
        %li Timing ends once the last runner finishes their category.
        %li The order in which games are run will be determined by each team individually.
        %li
          In the event of a game crash, if you created a save file during the 1545 race, you may load it. However, you may not load a file that was created before the race.
          %ul
            %li Savestates on emulator are also not allowed.
        %li
          If a game requires you to double check that you have completed the categories requirements afterwards, you may do so off stream.
          %ul
            %li Checking for completion should not be counted towards the final time.
            %li If you do not make the requirements, contact an organizer immediately, but have the next runner continue their run.
        %li
          In the event of a runner on your team not showing up, it is the team's responsibility to find someone else on the team to run.
          %ul
            %li What happens if no replacement runner can be found?
        %li
          If someone on your team decides to drop, contact an organizer immediately.
          %ul
            %li If a runner drops during the race, get another runner on your team to start running a different game quickly.
            %li If a replacement can be found, the run may be continued from any point before where it had been paused.
        %li
          If there is an emergency situation and you need to get an organizer immediately, post a message in
          %code #emergency-help
          with an
          %code @organizer
          mention. The channel will not exist until a few minutes before the race.
        %li
          If your stream crashes, try to get it back online immediately, but you may continue running. However, if it remains offline after a few minutes, contact an organizer in
          %code #emergency-help
          immediately.
        %li
          If you have a conflict within your team, try to get it settled with the team captain.
          %ul
            %li If an agreement cannot be reached, or if the conflict involves a captain, contact an organizer.
        %li
          If you still have a question, double check that it is not answered under a general rule or an individual game rule.
          %ul
            %li
              If it is still not answered, or if the answer is ambiguous, ask in the discord with an

              mention.
