          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>The rules for the 1545 are fairly straightforward. Rules for each game generally follow those posted on their respective <a href="http://speedrun.com">speedrun.com</a> pages. However, there are a few changes, mainly easing some restrictions on how runs are validated. For simplicity, the rules for each game are listed below the General Rules section.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions about these rules, feel free to contact an organizer for clarification.</p>
          <h2>General Rules</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>The first runner for each team will be in a general voice chat and will begin their game when an organizer says go after a countdown.</li>
            <li>Timing ends once the last runner finishes their category.</li>
            <li>The order in which games are run will be determined by each team individually.</li>
            <li>
              In the event of a game crash, if you created a save file during the 1545 race, you may load it. However, you may not load a file that was created before the race.
              <ul>
                <li>Savestates on emulator are also not allowed.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              If a game requires you to double check that you have completed the categories requirements afterwards, you may do so off stream.
              <ul>
                <li>Checking for completion should not be counted towards the final time.</li>
                <li>If you do not make the requirements, contact an organizer immediately, but have the next runner continue their run.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              In the event of a runner on your team not showing up, it is the team’s responsibility to find someone else on the team to run.
              <ul>
                <li>What happens if no replacement runner can be found?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              If someone on your team decides to drop, contact an organizer immediately.
              <ul>
                <li>If a runner drops during the race, get another runner on your team to start running a different game quickly.</li>
                <li>If a replacement can be found, the run may be continued from any point before where it had been paused.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              If there is an emergency situation and you need to get an organizer immediately, post a message in
              <code>#emergency-help</code>
              with an
              <code>@organizer</code>
              mention. The channel will not exist until a few minutes before the race.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your stream crashes, try to get it back online immediately, but you may continue running. However, if it remains offline after a few minutes, contact an organizer in
              <code>#emergency-help</code>
              immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you have a conflict within your team, try to get it settled with the team captain.
              <ul>
                <li>If an agreement cannot be reached, or if the conflict involves a captain, contact an organizer.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              If you still have a question, double check that it is not answered under a general rule or an individual game rule.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If it is still not answered, or if the answer is ambiguous, ask in the discord with an
                  <code>@organizer</code>
                  mention.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Individual Game Rules</h2>
          <h3>Super Mario 64</h3>
          <p>Complete the game while collecting all 120 stars (the Giant Star you collect after beating Final Bowser not being included in this 120 star total). No restrictions. All forms of BLJ are allowed.</p>
          <p>Timing starts from power on of the console (or reset on VC) and ends when you touch the Giant Star after defeating Final Bowser.</p>
          <h3>Super Mario Sunshine</h3>
          <p>Collect all 120 Shines then defeat Bowser, no restrictions. Timing starts when selecting 'Start' on a new file and ends on the final ground pound on Bowser.</p>
          <h3>Super Mario Galaxy</h3>
          <p>Start timing when selecting "Play This File," and end timing when touching the final Grand Star. Get all 120 Stars, then beat Bowser's Galaxy Reactor for a 2nd time. Runs must be timed in RTA timing, breaks are allowed but must be included into your final time.</p>

          <h3>Super Mario Galaxy 2</h3>
          <p>Beat the game with all the 242 stars collected (AKA 100%). This means that you have to beat Bowser’s Galaxy Generator twice: Once to unlock World S and another time to unlock the green stars. You do not have to beat Bowser’s Galaxy Generator again after The Perfect Run.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time starts as soon as you enter a new game file.</li>
            <li>Time stops on the same frame that you touch the star after The Perfect Run in Grandmaster Galaxy.</li>
            <li>All tricks, glitches and strategies in the game are allowed to beat the category faster.</li>
            <li>No mods, hacks or codes are allowed. You may only use the standard game mechanics.</li>
            <li>You are allowed to use the Banktoad.</li>
            <li>You are allowed to already have a 100% completed file to make Grandmaster Galaxy approach instantly after 240 stars are collected (Grandmaster Galaxy requires you to have 9999 starbits in Banktoad at any point in the run).</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Banjo-Kazooie</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete the game with no cheats and collect everything on the Game Totals screen (100 jiggies, 900 notes, and 24 honeycombs)</li>

            <li>All runs must have video evidence</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You can set up FFM beforehand with no penalty to your time.</p>
          <h3>Banjo-Tooie</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Collect everything on the Game Totals screen, and defeat Hag 1</li>

            <li>Cheato cheats are NOT allowed</li>
