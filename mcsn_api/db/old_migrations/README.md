This file contains migrations that occurred before switching from `micrate.cr` to `migrate`. The latter was chosen for better flexibility, more tools, and a cleaner in-language API.

While these migrations _should_ be valid for use with `migrate`, the versioning system isn't necessarily the same, so these have been moved to avoid any conflicts. New migrations are kept in the `migrations` folder next to this one.
