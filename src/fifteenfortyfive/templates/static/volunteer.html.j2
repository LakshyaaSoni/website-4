        <h1 class="title">1545 Staff Volunteering</h1>

        <p>As the 1545 continues to grow and expand into more events throughout the year, we're looking to add staff members that can help us build and maintain a high quality organization for running them. Below we've listed a few positions that we are specifically looking to fill. If you're interested in getting involved with the production of The 1545 or any new events we'll be planning in the future, check them out and hit us up either on Discord (by messaging an Organizer), or by email at <a href="mailto:{{conn.constants.volunteer_email}}">volunteer@fifteenfortyfive.org</a>! If you have other suggestions for positions that you'd like to fill, or any other feedback, feel free to talk to us about it!

        <h1 class="title">Marketing</h1>

        <p>The 1545 is first and foremost a convener, adept at cultivating a strong community of speedrunners with expertise in their games and a wish to help their fellow runners by extending that knowledge to their peers. We are looking for somebody who can help us develop content to provide maximum reach, impact and value to the entire speedrunning community through our Twitter page, Discord announcements, and other social platforms.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Runner Management</h1>

        <p>The Runner Management position is in charge of the runners and commentators that are involved with the various events put on by The 1545. As a manager, your job is to coordinate runners and commentators, make sure they’ve got everything set and ready to go for each event, and be willing to go the extra mile and find replacements in case somebody drops. Timely communication with the organizers is a must. If you have good leadership and decision-making skills, this position is for you!</p>

        <h1 class="title">Scheduling</h1>

        <p>With the addition of several new events to look forward to, quick scheduling becomes more and more essential within the 1545 community. As a scheduler, you will work with the rest of the 1545 staff in order to correctly balance teams and runners for each event, as well as with runner management to make sure everyone can be available when needed. For larger events, this may also include scheduling shifts for staff to make sure positions are always covered. If you love logistics, this is for you!</p>

        <h1 class="title">Stream Tech</h1>

        <p>With the unique premise of The 1545 come unique challenges in presentation on stream. To deal with this, we've developed custom tools to run and manage our streams. Now, as we grow into other events, we'll also be including more traditional stream management into our flow. As a stream tech, you are responsible for actively managing the stream content by working with dashboards, directly with OBS, and debugging problems as they arise. You will also be interacting with runner managers, organizers, and runners/commentators directly to help solve technical issues and make sure the live presentation of our events can run smoothly.</p>

        <p>This position also includes possibilities for working on developing new tools and stream layouts for various events, though this is not a requirement of the position.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Moderation</h1>

        <p>The idea behind The 1545 is rather complex and not intuitive to many outside viewers. Someone coming into the stream for the first time is very likely to be confused by what’s happening. Even after some explanation, they likely won’t understand a lot of the different decisions that have been made to get to where we are now. As a moderator, you will be responsible for informing the general community as to why certain decisions have been made regarding games, categories, runners, etc. per event. Moderators also help mitigate any conflicts that come up in chat, either on Twitch or Discord, and keep the environment friendly and welcoming for everyone.</p>

        <p>Moderators make themselves available on event days, with variable on hours depending on said event, and are generally an active member of the community.</p>
