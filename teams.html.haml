          %p The race will consist of 6 teams. Each team also has a captain, who is in charge of managing their team's run schedule and who will be the main point-of-contact for the team. Captains are indicated below with a star. If you are a team captain, you should have received a message from the organizers with more information.

          %p These assignments were created such that the estimated total time for each team is as close as possible. Our hope is that this results in a more interesting race both for the runners and those watching the race.

          %p For those interested in more details: the average overall estimate (regardless of team structure) is 53:58:40. 3 teams are within 2 minutes of this time, and all teams are within 13 minutes. The standard deviation between the estimates is just over 6 minutes (6:11). That's less than 0.2% of the overall time!
